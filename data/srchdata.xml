Welcome to One Path 101. The purpose of this session is to train our team on processes that will impact our day to day.

I will break down the benefit qualifiers a little later in the training.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;DMI – Distribution Margin Incentive and is backend compensation for the distributor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

		<related-content>&lt;TextFlow xmlns = "http://ns.adobe.com/textLayout/2008" fontFamily = "Verdana" fontSize = "9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Let’s take a minute to review the One Path Pricing Ladder.  There are 3 components to the engagement model...No Touch, Low Touch, and High Touch.  No Touch is available directly to the channel where there is no HPE involvement which includes Discount Now and Smart buy pricing.  Low Touch pricing comes into play when the partner wants to come in and register for benefits once approved they apply their benefits to their no touch pricing which again is Discount Now and Smart Buy.  High Touch the partner still needs more aggressive pricing so they come back and request &amp;quot;Escalated Pricing“ meaning special pricing in our world today.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Discount Now pricing stacked with Solution and Segment benefits is designed to equate to VEP Tier 4 pricing.  There are 3 options for Discount Now which is based on the segment…so there will be a FED DN, SLED DN, and then all others.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;In One Path, a partner can register for benefits and request special pricing at the same time.  It is no longer a serial process.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

I will start with Segment because it only has 1 requirement which is a kicker to incent the partners to sell into our&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; Commercial 2, SMB, and SLED/FED accounts they will be eligible for this benefit. Solution Benefit has 3 requirements&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;1)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; the partner must be a medal partner….silver, gold, or platinum. 2) partner has to provide documented levels of pre-sales value add activity. 3) TS attach:  we will now &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;require&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;1:1 TS support be sold with the HW meaning if you are selling 50 servers they have&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; to &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;attach 1 u&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;plifted service for each server&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Both Benefits are exclusive to one partner per opportunity.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Solution and Segment benefit amounts move from % of list to % of net when they go from using Discount Now pricing to BD Special pricing.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

We will factor it into deal financials when we escalate to finance for pricing approval.  DMI is not to be discussed with resellers.  And it's non-negotiable.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;These amounts range from &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; .5 – 3% of net&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; depending on the PL.  If you want to know how much each PL pulls then those percentages can be found in the playground of the iComp.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Quick recap – frontend benefits are for the reseller and backend is to the distributor.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

In this example the lead partner has more aggressive BD pricing:  $10K ($70,000-$60,000) lower than the Non-Lead partner for same config (as Non-Lead partners are approved at Typical level), plus Lead partner gets $7,800 ($5,400+$2,400) in solution and segment benefit.  It’s up to the lead partner whether or not they contribute any of their benefits to hitting the end user price.  In total, Lead partner has better pricing by $17,500. ($70,000-52,200)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Let’s Assume the scenario where Non-Lead partner comes with different config, in this example they get special pricing at $85K (Typical level) and there are no benefits. The difference in BD pricing between Lead and Non-Lead in this example is $25,000 and considering the benefits it’s $32,500.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;The delta between the lead partner and Non-Lead partner BD special pricing ($60,000 vs. $85,000) may cause escalation to the BDM to bring Non-Lead partner pricing closer to lead partner pricing.  Use defined escalation process when/if this arises.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

		<related-content>&lt;TextFlow xmlns = "http://ns.adobe.com/textLayout/2008" fontFamily = "Verdana" fontSize = "9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;This slide details the Solution and Segment benefit percentages that are applicable when a BD is applied.  The benefit percentages change from a percent off of list to a percent off of net when a partner goes from Discount now to special pricing.   What is important to note here is that Solution benefits are slightly higher for Platinum resellers vs. Non-Platinum resellers.  Segment Benefits remain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; constant&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.  Later in the presentation we will review the new comments and so&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; reading the comments will be so important&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; to understand from PDO because if the partner is Platinum level their&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; benefits are slightly better and we will need to apply the correct benefit when escalating&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

		<related-content>&lt;TextFlow xmlns = "http://ns.adobe.com/textLayout/2008" fontFamily = "Verdana" fontSize = "9"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span &gt;Now lets get into what we are familiar with DART&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;oday when we escalate&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;for&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Value Indirect deal and we take it into&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; dart the selling motion will show Corp Reseller.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;- When escalating both Channel Factory and Channel Stock deals, the BDM must select the selling motion from the dropdown based on the benefits the LEAD partner qualifies for.  Remember, you can only escalate pricing to finance for requests made by the lead partner.  Non-Lead partners can not receive finance escalated pricing.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;I am now going to make a point of reference to a new benefit that I have not previously mentioned.  Cloud Builder:  while it may be a new term to most BDM’s it is not a new benefit Historically, it is used less than 1% of all deals approved and we are not familiar with it.  However, it is being transferred from our old benefits to One Path.  You might not ever see this benefit but keep in mind that it is an eligible benefit and careful when selecting the selling motion in DART.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>

So we had to shorten the benefit names to fit into dart so we created a key to keep us honest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Also&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; note there are&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; multiple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt; avenues the lead partner can qualify for.  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;Remember Solution benefits differ between Platinum and Non-Platinum partners.  Segment benefit has no differentiation.  This menu represents 2 scenarios for the benefits...Platinum and Non-Platinum.  If this is a platinum partner, you will need to ensure that you select &amp;quot;platsol&amp;quot; in your benefit dropdown options.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span &gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/TextFlow&gt;</related-content>
